# CS F342 – Computer Architecture Labs

---

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains all laboratory work for CS F342 – Computer Architecture.

You will use one repository and one GitHub Codespace for the entire semester.
All labs build on each other, so do not create separate repositories per lab.

---

## 2. Getting Started

### Step 1: Open in GitHub Codespaces

1. Open this repository on GitHub
2. Click Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main
3. Wait for the Codespace to finish setting up

You are expected to work inside Codespaces. This will allow you to complete the labs and assignments later, in case you do not finish them in the lab, without needing to set up the tools on your own computer.
